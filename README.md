# Aligned Automation Internship

This repository contains daily tasks and projects completed during my internship focused on **Python automation and scripting**. The goal was to gain hands-on experience and transition from **zero to hero** in **Generative AI** and **Python programming**.

## 📅 Duration
10 Days of continuous learning and implementation.
